Simon
======
The Simon application was built as a recreation of the handheld [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
game in Android. The goal of the game is to repeat the given pattern as many times
as possible. With each successful iteration, an additional random color is added
to the pattern.

The application includes three game modes. One standard mode, a mode where color
has to matched, a mode where position has to be matched, and eXtreme mode where
the pattern is played in red, reversed and at significantly faster pace.

## Android Applications
This application was built for an android development class. Other projects include:
* [Blackjack](https://github.com/nonamehero2/Blackjack)
* [Simon](https://github.com/casualdragon/Simon)
* [AZ_Paint](https://github.com/nonamehero2/AZ_Paint)
* [Dungeon_Crawler](https://github.com/nonamehero2/DungeonCrawler)

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to experiment with playing sounds and using
threads properly in Android.

## Problem(s)
* Threads are complicated and can easily allow a developer to make an application
that acts in a strange fashion.
* Sounds had to be found and sound pool had to be timed so there was no distortion when they
were played.
* This was our first attempt at a more object oriented rebuild. This was successful
to a degree but was done after the fact to no immediate benefit of the developers.
* Lack of comments.

## Devices
This app was tested with the Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x Emulator.
